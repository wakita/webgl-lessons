mat4.create()
	Returns a 16 element array. If WebGL is enabled, array type will be WebGLFloatArray, otherwise it will be a standard javascript Array.

mat4.set(mat, dest)
	Copies the contents of mat into dest.

mat4.identity(dest)
	Set dest to an identity matrix.

mat4.transpose(mat, dest)
	Transposes mat

mat4.determinant(mat)
	Returns the determinant of mat. mat is left unchanged.

mat4.inverse(mat, dest)
	Inverts mat

mat4.toMat3(mat, dest)
	Populates dest with the upper 3x3 elements of the matrix. (ie: The rotation matrix). dest is expected to be a sequence of at least 9 elements. If dest is not specified a new 9 element array is created and returned.

mat4.toInverseMat3(mat, dest)
	Calculates the inverse of the top 3x3 elements of mat. (ie: calculates the normal matrix). dest is expected to be a sequence of at least 9 elements. If dest is not specified a new 9 element array is created and returned.

mat4.multiply(mat, mat2, dest)
	Multiplies mat and mat2

mat4.multiplyVec3(mat, vec, dest)
	Multiplies the the vector vec by mat. vec and dest are expected to be sequences of at least 3 elements. If dest is not provided the result is written into vec.

mat4.translate(mat, vec, dest)
	Translates mat by the vector vec.

mat4.scale(mat, vec, dest)
	Scales mat by the vector vec.

mat4.rotate(mat, angle, axis, dest)
	Rotates mat by angle (given in radians) around the axis given by the vector axis.

mat4.frustum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far, dest)
	Calculates a frustum matrix with the given parameters and writes it into dest.

mat4.perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far, dest)
	Calculates a perspective matrix with the given parameters and writes it into dest.

mat4.ortho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far, dest)
	Calculates a orthogonal matrix with the given parameters and writes it into dest.
